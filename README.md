**scratchblocks2** is used to write Scratch scripts:

- in [Scratch Forum](http://scratch.mit.edu/discuss/topic/14772/) posts
- in [Scratch Wiki](http://wiki.scratch.mit.edu/wiki/Block_Plugin) articles _(using [the MediaWiki plugin](https://github.com/blob8108/mw-ScratchBlocks2))_
- in the [Code Club](https://www.codeclub.org.uk) project guides _(using [pandoc_scratchblocks](https://github.com/CodeClub/pandoc_scratchblocks); see [CodeClub/lesson_format](https://github.com/CodeClub/lesson_format))_

It's MIT licensed, so you can use it in your projects. But email me afterward; I'd love to hear about it :)

## Syntax

It's inspired by the block plugin by JSO that was used on
the old [Scratch Forums](http://scratch.mit.edu/discuss/). It's a complete
rewrite for Scratch 2.0, but it still uses the same syntax (with some minor
additions).

It follows the philosophy of the original Block Plugin in that it tries to match
the code you write as closely as possible, and doesn't check you've used the
correct syntax. The block text is only used to find the correct colour.

For the full guide to the syntax, see [the
wiki](http://wiki.scratch.mit.edu/wiki/Block_Plugin/Syntax).

## Translation

The version of [`translations.js`](https://github.com/blob8108/scratchblocks2/blob/master/src/translations.js) in this repo is designed for the Scratch Forums, so it supports [all the languages there](http://scratch.mit.edu/discuss/#category_head_6).

However, it _can_ be made to accept any of the languages that Scratch supports. You just need to modify and run [`build_translations.py`](https://github.com/blob8108/scratchblocks2/blob/master/src/build_translations.py) yourself, which will fetch language files from the [Scratch translation server](http://translate.scratch.mit.edu).

scratchblocks2 also requires some [additional words](https://github.com/blob8108/scratchblocks2/blob/master/src/extra_strings.py) which aren't in Scratch itself (mainly the words used for the flag and arrow images). I'd be happy to accept pull requests for those!

# Usage

If you just want the code, have a look at the [example HTML
file](http://github.com/blob8108/scratchblocks2/blob/master/example.html),
which uses the scripts hosted on GitHub Pages, and jQuery hosted off Google.

For a more detailed explanation, or if you want to host the files yourself, read on.

You need to include jQuery (in the `<head>` of your page):

```html
<script src="//code.jquery.com/jquery-2.1.1.js"></script>
```

Then include the scratchblocks2 CSS and JS:

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="scratchblocks2.css">
<script src="scratchblocks2.js"></script>
```

Then just call `scratchblocks2.parse` after the page has loaded, which will
render matching page elements to shiny scratch blocks. Its sole argument is the
CSS-style selector for the elements that contain the scratchblocks code. It
uses `pre.blocks` by default.

```js
scratchblocks2.parse("pre.blocks");
```

Finally, you need to put `flag.png` and `arrows.png` in the folder
`block_images`, which must be in the same folder as `scratchblocks2.css`.

In summary, your directory layout should look something like this:

    block_images/
        arrows.png
        flag.png
    scratchblocks2.css
    scratchblocks2.js

## Inline blocks

To use blocks inside a paragraph...

```html
I'm rather fond of the <code class="b">stamp</code> block in Scratch.
```

...make a separate call to `parse` using the `inline` argument.

```js
scratchblocks2.parse("code.b", {inline: true});
```
